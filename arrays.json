It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions.\n**gruvbox:**\n> Designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of solarized.

a CIA operation....:troll:","Lmao","Other elements of the alternative timeline of Italy included : some propaganda billboards about the socialist leader with slogans like : \"Let's make the People's Republic a great nation!\", \"Death to US imperialism!\", or statues of \"martyrs of socialism\" like Nicolae Ceausescu, Vladimir Lenin, etc...\nThe car radio broadcasted an existing song which the AI outputted perfectly \"Eiffel 65 - Blue\", then after walking in the park with the cute crush, Gerry went with her at her home and she showed a cool computer game similar to Call Of Duty but you fight
